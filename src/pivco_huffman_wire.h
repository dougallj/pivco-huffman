/* pivco_huffman_wire.h — single source of truth for the per-node wire format.
 *
 * All backends MUST consume/produce the per-non-flat-internal-node wire
 * record through these helpers.  Previously each backend hand-rolled
 * the read/write of K_right header + FSE marker byte + bitmap bytes,
 * which led to silent drift (scalar+NEON added the FSE marker byte in
 * 2026-05-13, x86+AVX-512 didn't — broke scalar↔SSE cross-decoding).
 *
 * Wire format (v0.7): file data in decompression order, larger-K
 * child first.  The layout is an Euler walk of the tree — each node's
 * K_right split header lands at its pre-order position (on the way
 * down), its marker+bitmap record at its post-order position (on the
 * way up, after its children's regions):
 *
 * Per-block header (once, at the very start of each encoded block):
 *   [block_N: uint16 LE, 2 bytes]                  symbol count N for this
 *                                                  block; the decoder reads
 *                                                  it before starting the
 *                                                  tree walk.  Lets the
 *                                                  codec encode any N up to
 *                                                  65535 — no longer pinned
 *                                                  to PIVCO_BLOCK_SIZE.
 *
 * Per non-flat internal node:
 *   [optional K_right: uint16 LE, 2 bytes]         if kr_header_needed();
 *                                                  at node entry
 *   [larger-K child region][smaller child region]  recursively, same layout;
 *                                                  larger first (strict >,
 *                                                  ties left-first), keyed
 *                                                  on the K_right header —
 *                                                  no extra bits
 *   [FSE marker byte:        uint8,    1 byte]    always
 *   [bitmap body]                                  marker == 0: raw n-bit
 *                                                  bitmap, ceil(n/8) bytes
 *                                                  marker != 0: 2-byte LE
 *                                                  fse_len + fse_len bytes
 *                                                  of FSE-compressed bytes
 *
 * This is exactly the order the BU decoder consumes bytes.  It needs
 * both child counts up front to size the children's buffers — and
 * forward parsing of variable-size regions requires the sizing
 * information in prefix position anyway — but it consumes a node's
 * bitmap only at merge time, after both children are decoded.  So the
 * stream is read strictly forward, each byte touched once, and the
 * decoder's L1 working set is a moving window instead of the whole
 * compressed block.
 *
 * The larger-K child goes first so the decoder meets each node's
 * dominant half while the smaller sibling's buffer is still empty —
 * the decoder can overlap the larger child's working scratch with
 * that hole, which is what lets the scratch arena stay near N (see
 * the decode tree walk in pivco_huffman_codec.c).  Both sides key the
 * order on the K_right header already on the wire, so it costs no
 * bits.
 *
 * The K_right header occupies one slot per recursion site into a
 * non-leaf child (kr_header_needed()): leaf-only nodes (BOTH_LEAVES,
 * LEAF_LEFT's leaf side) carry no count, and empty subtrees (n == 0)
 * emit nothing at all.
 *
 * Flat-subtree nodes do NOT use the per-node record — they emit n·D
 * packed bits directly (they have no children, so pre- and post-order
 * coincide).  See pivco_huffman.h:flat_depth.
 *
 * Internal header, not part of the public API.
